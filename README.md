# SFC System (temporary name)

## Description
> This project is related with the building of a shop floor control system for small businesses. It is focused to control the shop floor processes in a basic manner, without the usage of M.R.P. process. Its functionality must be deacoupled of the order rules, it just need to show the current snapshot of the entire shop floor, and also need to show the delivery date of the parts and products, showing if the part or product is inside the deadline or not.

## Points to be covered by the solution
* The average processing time of each product machinery/assembly step
* Follow-up the current position of each product part accross the shop floor, monitoring its position in the flow, order number and deadline
* The sku amount in stock and the stock place where they are
* Movimentation history of all the sku's in each stock place
* The product structure, from the smallest parts to the entire assembled product
* A code designer for each product item, where the code has a logic which defines its description
* Each item must have its own production time or delivery time (for products which must be bought from third-party companies), to allow the system to define the order delivery date

## Main goal
> The idea of this project is to attend small bussineses that does not need to use any complex processment to control the shop floor such as a M.R.P. process. First it will start as a small project, where if it grows up, it will become a commercial solution.
