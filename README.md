# SFC System (temporary name)
> This project is related with the building of a shop floor control system for small businesses. It is focused to control the shop floor processes, where the system must have the following features:
* The average processing time of each product machinery/assembly step
* Follow-up the current position of each product part accross the shop floor, monitoring its position in the flow, order number and deadline
* The sku amount in stock and the stock place where they are
* Movimentation history of all the sku's
* The product structure, from the smallest parts to the entire assembled product
* A code designer for each product item, where the code has a logic which defines its description
* Each item must have its own production time or delivery time (for products which must be bought from third-party companies), to allow the system to define the order delivery date
